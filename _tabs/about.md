Hey — I’m **RootStealer**. I’m a passionate **CTF player**, **security researcher**, and **blog writer** who enjoys turning tricky problems into clear, teachable writeups.

I spend my time:
- Solving CTF challenges on **HackTheBox** and **TryHackMe**  
- Hunting and researching real-world vulnerabilities  
- Writing detailed walkthroughs and tutorials to help others learn

### What I focus on
- Binary/exploit development & reverse engineering  
- Web security and real-world attack paths  
- Privilege escalation and post-exploitation techniques

### Why I write
Sharing knowledge helps the community level up. My posts aim to be practical: step-by-step, reproducible, and focused on the reasoning behind each move.
